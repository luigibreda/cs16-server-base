- Special thanks to KiDwItAgUn for his 
"Hawaii" and "greyhostage" hostage skins.
- Special thanks to Stealth_Assassin for 
his “Tuxedo dude” hostage skins.

A rather large house has been broken 
into by a group of terrorists.  While 
entering the house, the terrorists 
tripped one of the silent alarms that 
immediately dispatched a group of 
counter-terrorists to the scene. 

CT:  Evacuate as many hostages as you 
can before the time is up.  You can do 
so by taking the hostages to any of 
four entrances. 

T: Kill the CTs.

NOTE:  There are TEN hostages.
You can not kill the gman...or can you?
