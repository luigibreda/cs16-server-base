This is the second map I've made...

It is quite a simple and small map.  Pick up guns, 
shoot the enemy.  The theme is based on two towns 
fighting each other over a depleated river, connected 
by two bridges.  The town (side) you are on supplies you 
with free weapons.  It's dawn, go and fight  :)
