Background: The students have had it with their teachers.
It is time to fight back.  They have taken a number of
teachers as hostages and are attempting to destroy the
school.  Because of this revolt, other schools are
likely to revolt as well. An unknown source has provided
the students with a Terran Battlecruiser.

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the students from destroying
the school and to rescue the teachers that are being
held in the school gym.  A combat drop has been ordered
on the battlecruiser, the threat will be neutralized.
Prevent the destruction of the school.

Students: DESTROY THE FRICKEN SCHOOL WITH THE C-4 BOMB
WE MADE OUT OF GYM EQUIPMENT!!! DO NOT LET THE CT'S
RESCUE THE HOSTAGES! The Battlecruiser we built out of
school supplies should provide enough cover fire for us.
If you can, destroy the tanks outside the school either
with grenades or the MG Nest.
