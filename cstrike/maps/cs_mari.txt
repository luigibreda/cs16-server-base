==========================================

The "Drug Control Organizaton" has uncovered
 a secret marihuana plantation,
situated near the Bikini Hangout@ Mansion 
and has prepared a plan to raid it.
It was decided that the operation would take place
during the next shippment from the plantation.

==========================================

Counter-Terrorists: 
 - Enter Bikini Hangout@ Mansion to rescue
   the possible hostages and bring them to
   safety unharmed. Take out the Terrorists.

Terrorists: 
 - Take hostages or take out the CT's 
   is only way to escape.

Other Notes:
 - There are 4 hostages in 
   the mission and 3 hostage rescue zones.
