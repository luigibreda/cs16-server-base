Hollywood, 1939.
Amid the glitz and glitter of a bustling 
movie town, at the height of it's golden 
age, the Hollywood Tower Hotel was a star 
in it's own right, a beacon for the 
show-business elite..

You are about to discover what lies beyond 
the 5th dimension. Beyond the deepest 
darkest corner of the imagination... in 
the Tower of Terror.
