The CT's (Starfleet) have to defend the ship.

The T's (Borg) have to destroy it by placing a bomb near the Warpcore
or in a freight room.

In this map the money is "replicator energy". Projecile Weapons are used, 
because the Borg can't "adjust" to such weapons.

The map is a bit complex so get familiar to it before you play it.
