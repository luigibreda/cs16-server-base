In the 2nd coming of the BigCity a terrorist 
group has devised a fiendish plot to eliminate 
the city of all it’s loitering patrons.  For some 
reason the CTs are really pissed off about this 
and are planning to stop the Ts.  But in order to 
save the loitering dudes the CTs have to move them 
to the rescue zone, which would make the loiterers 
no longer loitering.  So either way the CTs loose 
if you think about it.  Ahhh the hell with it, if 
you’re a CT just rescue the goddamn hostages and 
shut up.

CT: locate and rescue the four 
hostages standing around the city.

T: Kill the CTs.
