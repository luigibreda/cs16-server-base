CT:  Rush the Ts position and plant the
bomb under the T trench.  Plan your attack!  

T: Hold your position and repel the CT attack.  
Use the gun turrets.  You will need them!

Note:  The grate at T spawn will open after 
a short time.  The button behind it blows up 
the CT spawn, this is to kill any CTs that 
might be AFK.
