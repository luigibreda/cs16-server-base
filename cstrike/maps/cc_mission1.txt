Intelligence tells us that two US POWs 
have been taken to a small compound in 
southern Iraq.  The Cherryclan has been 
appointed the task of rescuing them.

CTs:  With the help of two tanks and an 
APC search the compound for the two POWs.

Ts:  Defend your territory and prevent 
the rescue of the POWs.


NOTE:  The hostages can be rescued by 
taking them to the CT camp OR by 
brining them to the back of the APC.
